- **fleet race** - Sail fast using RC
- **search** - Autonomously find a buoy in a 100m search radius
- **station keeping** - Keep the boat within a 40x40m box for a specific amount of time
- **endurance** - Sail for as far and long as possible around a box autonomously or RC
- **precision navigation** - Autonomously round buoys in a triangle and exit within a 3m gap between two buoys
